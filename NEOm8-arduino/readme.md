# GPS Logger with TinyGPS++ and SoftwareSerial

This Arduino sketch reads GPS data from a NEO-M8N GPS module using the `TinyGPSPlus` and `SoftwareSerial` libraries. It logs location, altitude, speed, satellite count, and UTC date/time to the Serial Monitor.

## 📦 Requirements

* **Arduino Board** (e.g., Uno, Nano)
* **NEO-M8N GPS Module**
* **Libraries:**

  * [TinyGPSPlus](https://github.com/mikalhart/TinyGPSPlus)
  * `SoftwareSerial` (included with Arduino IDE)

## 🛠️ Wiring

| GPS Module Pin | Arduino Pin |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| TX             | D4          |
| RX             | D3          |
| VCC            | 5V          |
| GND            | GND         |

> ⚠️ Note: Connect **GPS TX to Arduino RX (D4)** and **GPS RX to Arduino TX (D3)** via `SoftwareSerial`.

## 🔧 Configuration

* Default GPS baud rate is set to **9600**. If no data appears, try changing it to **38400** in the `gpsSerial.begin()` line.

## ▶️ How to Use

1. Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.
2. Open the **Serial Monitor** at **9600 baud**.
3. After a brief wait, GPS data such as latitude, longitude, speed, altitude, satellites, and UTC time/date will appear.
4. If the GPS module is not receiving data, a warning will be printed.

## 🧾 Output Example

```
Latitude: 37.421998
Longitude: -122.084000
Altitude: 10.00
Speed: 0.00
Satellites: 7
HDOP: 0.90
Date: 27/06/2025
Time (UTC): 12:34:56
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

* **"Location: INVALID"** – GPS hasn't locked on to a satellite yet.
* **"No GPS data detected. Check wiring or baud rate."** – Likely a wiring issue or incorrect baud rate. Double-check connections and try different baud rates (`9600` or `38400`).
